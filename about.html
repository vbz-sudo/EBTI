      <p>
      AFC Zambia is a member of the Ambassadors for Christ International Fellowship (AFCIF). Ambassadors for Christ is a ministry arm of the Church composed of anointed evangelists and Bible teachers, united by a shared calling to renew the spiritual life of the Church, reach the unsaved with the Gospel, and support the Church’s growth in maturity and mission.

AFC Zambia is both interdenominational and evangelical, bringing together believers from diverse church backgrounds. Our team—comprising evangelists, Bible teachers, and ministry workers—labors together to strengthen the Church within our cultural context. Oversight is provided by a board of mature Christian leaders who ensure the ministry stays true to its mission.

AFC Zambia works alongside other Christian organizations to exalt the name of the Lord Jesus Christ across Zambia and beyond through:
•	Evangelistic gospel crusades in partnership with local churches
•	Bible teaching programs, seminars, and conferences in both urban and rural communities

The AFCI Zambia Ebenezer Bible Training & Retreat Centre was established to train and equip pastors, church leaders, and Christian workers for effective ministry. After years of conducting mobile training in rented venues, God has blessed us with a permanent facility—a testimony to His faithfulness. The name Ebenezer reflects our journey of faith and God's divine provision.
